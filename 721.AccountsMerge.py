# Mehthod: DFS
# Time Complexity: 
    # N: num of account; K: max num of emails per user
    # graph traversal: time to traversal all emails: O(NK)
    # each time sort emaillist: perform sort N times and each time sort length K list: O(N*logK)
    # total: multiply them, O(N*K*N*logK)
    
# Space Complexity: dominate by graph, O(NK)
